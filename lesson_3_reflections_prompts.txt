When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositroy can be used when we wanna collaborate with others, access the repositories
  from another computer, share our repositories with others and publish the repositories.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We might want to always manually pull changes so that we can pull only the changes we want
	not pull the changes we don't want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repositories we make on GitHub. We would use forks when
	-We don't have permission to modify someone else's repository and wanna modify it.
	-We wanna use someone else's repository as a base for our project.
	-We wanna modify someone else's repository and acknowledge that person.
	-We wanna create and modify repositories and work with collaborators.
	-We can edit the files on GitHub

	Clones are copies of repositories we make on our own machines locally. We would use clones when
	-We wanna edit the files on our own machines.
	-We don't wanna update the repositories on GitHub right away.
	-We wanna make one or more experimental versions of the repositories on GitHub and don't wanna fork again and again.
	-We wanna work locally and without internet access.

	Branches are paths for committing we make in our repositories. We would use branches when
	-We wanna work on new features and not include them in the final versions of our projects just yet.
	-We wanna fix or try fixing one or more bugs and not include any changes in the final versions of our projects just yet.
	-We wanna make alternate versions of our projects that we don't wanna include them in the final versions of our projects just yet.
	-We wanna push or pull only some commits from our repositories online to and from our repositories on GitHub and forks.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally can help us work offline. We can continue
	to work offline with the reference, the locally stored copy, of the remote, without needing internet access,
	which is useful in certain situations, when we don't have internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	If we use another version-control system or platform, what would be easier and what would be harder would depend on the
	comparision of the features of Git and GitHub and the features of the version-control system and platform we are using.
	If we are not using any version-control system or platform, some or all things we can do without internet connection, like
	having a discussion about what changes we should make and what new features and functionality we should add, and reviewing
	and having a discussion about each other's changes and proposed ideas and prototypes, could be easier, but every collaborator
	will have to be in person, and that's why it could be easier at some points, because every collaborator is in person, and
	some things might be done greatly when everyone	is attenttive at the same time. That is not to say that this could not be
	done over an internet connection from different	places, but there are some advantages over the other in	both cases (Not
	in context of this question, but the best way when working would be to use these advantages wisely, everything can be done
	over an internet connection, you get the point). As talking about what would be harder, working from different places and
	without internet connection could be harder, because we will have to meet together from time to time to check what's happening
	on the project in account of everyone's changes, and this can be harder compared to how we would collaborate using Git and GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	We would want to make changes in a separate branch when we're working on features which are not ready to be added in the main
	version of the stable project. This way we can work on new features, collaborate with others, get feedback on the new features,
	identify and fix problems and make them stable and ready for use in the final build of the project before adding it to the main
	version of the stable project which is meant for public use (Or consumer use). This approach is beneficial for doing all of this
	as it is helpful in making new features or changes and making them stable and completely ready before merging them into the main
	project branch and is also helpful in collaborating with others. Making changes directly in master branch is beneficial when making
	changes which we know are exactly ready to be added into the project as it is less complicated than the other approach as we don't
	have to merge it with any other branches along with all of the other steps required in the other approach and is quicker than the other approach.
